# Hi, I’m Nathan 
Creative turned developer. Scotland, UK.

I started as a jazz musician. Discipline and improvisation shaped how I think.  
Now I apply that same mindset to building software.

I build obsessively. I enjoy the challenge. I like solving real problems for real people.

## 🧠 How I Build

I work heavily with AI models as development accelerators.

When I run out of API credits, I switch to local models.  
Agentic coding has accelerated how fast ideas can move.

This year is simple:  
**Build. Build. Build.**
