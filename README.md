Deep in build mode.  
Started as a jazz musician. Took discipline and improvisation into software.

Right now I care about one thing: shipping real projects.

🎤 Jonny Pettit – Custom-built musician website focused on clean presentation and artist-first design.

🧠 Zerua – Experimental system exploring scalable architecture and structured application design.

📋 Task Manager – Lightweight CRUD-based task tracking app built to reinforce backend fundamentals.

🥊 Fight Swipe – Swipe-based fight comparison app exploring crowd-driven ranking mechanics.

🥋 Pocket Dojo – Martial arts themed platform experimenting with structured content and interactive flows.

⛓️ Fight Scoring – Solidity smart contract implementing deterministic on-chain fight scoring logic.

## What I’m Doing

Building custom websites tailored to specific needs.

Working heavily with AI models to accelerate development.  
Running local models when API credits run out.

Exploring agentic coding workflows.  
Testing how far execution speed can go.

This year is simple:  
Build. Improve. Repeat.

## 🎯 Long-Term Direction

Move into building dApps.  
Push into distributed systems.  
See what creativity looks like on-chain.

Software is just another instrument.
