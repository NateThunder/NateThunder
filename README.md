Deep in build mode.  
Started as a jazz musician. Took discipline and improvisation into software.

Right now I care about one thing: shipping real projects.

Building custom websites tailored to specific needs.

Working heavily with AI models to accelerate development.  
Running local models when API credits run out.

Exploring agentic coding workflows.  
Testing how far execution speed can go.

This year is simple:  
Build. Improve. Repeat.
